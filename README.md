# Hack-Week-Project
A group project made for our CS4830 class

## Introduction
Group Name: Error 404
Group Members: Lee Offir (back-end), Austin Parrish (back-end), Jack Huffman (front-end), John Lund-Molfese (front-end) 
Background Information: We loved the in-class examples of Socket.io and wanted to create our own version of a chat app
## Problem:
Our users need an application to communicate quickly via easy-to-read, short messages.
## Solution
The solution is to create a website that serves as a chatroom. We would be able to visit our website and send messages between all the visitors of the page.
## Implementation
Our chat app used a variety of frameworks to reach the final product. We decided to use a framework of Node.js called Express.js to deploy our project at our specified port. Communication between users was handled with Socket.io, a framework that allows communication via Websockets that work both ways between the client and the server. Styling was handled with Bootstrap, and thus allowed us to make a mobile-friendly application.
## Future Work
We would like to connect a database to store chat messages, such as MongoDB or MySQL. We would also like to include a Google sign in feature that would auto-populate the username field.
