# Hack-Week-Project
A group project made for our CS4830 class

## Introduction
Group Name: Error 404  
Group Members: Lee Offir, Austin Parrish, Jack Huffman, John Lund-Molfese  
Background Information: We loved the in-class examples of Socket.io and wanted to create our own version of a chat app 
## Problem:
Our users need an application to communicate quickly, in easy-to-read, short posts.
## Solution
The solution is to create an imageboard. Additionally, we will have a real-time chat app on the side of the site.
## Implementation
We stored posts on the imageboard as mustache templates within a MariaDB database.
## Future Work
We would like to connect a database to store chat messages, such as MongoDB or MySQL. We would also like to include a Google sign in feature that would auto-populate the username field.
